# (Prosper Rating DataSet)
## by (Amira Yousif Mohamed)


## Dataset

The dataset consisted of borrower APRs and attributes of 113,937 loans. The attributes included original loan amount, borrower's Prosper rating, loan term, borrower's stated monthly income, as well as many other features such as borrower's employment status, debt to income ratio, current loan status etc. The dataset can be found here, with feature documentation available here


## Summary of Findings

In the exploration, I found that the borrower APR is negatively related with original loan amount. At different size of the loan amount, the APR has a large range, but the range of APR decrease with the increase of loan amount. The borrower APR also decreases with the increasingly better rating. Borrowers with the best Prosper ratings have the lowest APR. It means that the Prosper rating has a strong effect on borrower APR.. But people with lower ratings tend to borrow less money, decreasing APR could encourage them to borrow more. the range of loans amount in term 12 monthes is under 20000 with higher terms we can see higher amounts and lower APR Term has no effect on the relation between loan amount and APR

Outside of the main variables of interest, I found that the loan amount is positively correlated with the  income range, it makes sense since borrowers with more monthly income could loan more money. The loan amount is also increased with the increase of loan term. I also found that borrowers with better ratings have larger monthly income and loan amount. Employed, self-employed and full time borrowers have more monthly income and loan amount than part-time, retired and not employed borrowers. There is a interaction between categorical term and Prosper rating features. 

## Key Insights for Presentation

For the presentation, I just focus on features that could affect the borrower APR, which are original loan amount, Prosper rating.
